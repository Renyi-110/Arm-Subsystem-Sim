# Arm Subsystem Sim

This template provides a partially completed WPILib Java project for a differential (tank-style) drive robot with an Arm Subsystem with one kraken motor.

Students are to add the REV Through Bore encoder to act as an 0 position for the arm & output it to smartdashboard. 
Students should also do pseodocode on their own branch above each file or comment each method throughly, whichever helps them understand the code best.
